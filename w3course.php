<!_ this is just a throwaway page i made while learning PHP _>
<h1>My first PHP page</h1>


<?php
# This is the first piece of code i wrote that executed PHP inside HTML, which apparently need the file to use the PHP extention, and not HTML, even though html sorrounds the PHP, but that's because a .PHP file can execute .js, .css, .html and .php (also plain text) which is pretty neat.
echo "Hello World!<br>";
$x = 5 /*i can make inline comments too*/ + /*15 + */ 5;
echo $x . " newline <br>";
?>

</body>

<?php
# i made a php variable thingy, are u proud of me future self?
$txt ="my bunny";
echo "I love $txt!";
?>
